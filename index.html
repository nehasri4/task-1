      <h1>Welcome to Agriculture</h1>
      <p>Agriculture is the backbone of the economy in many countries, especially in rural areas. It involves the cultivation of crops and the rearing of animals to produce food, raw materials, and other products essential for human life. Agriculture not only provides employment to a large portion of the population but also ensures food security. With advancements in technology, modern farming methods such as irrigation systems, use of fertilizers, and genetically modified crops have greatly increased productivity. Sustainable agriculture is now gaining importance as it focuses on protecting the environment, conserving resources, and ensuring long-term agricultural productivity.</p>
